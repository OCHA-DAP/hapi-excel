# hapi-excel

This repo holds some Power Queries for accessing HDX HAPI and the HDX CKAN API, they are developed in Visual Code with the Power Query Extension installed but need to be copied into the Power Query Advanced Editor in Excel (or PowerBI) to run. The user needs to supply an `app_identifier` and the `HDX_API_KEY` for the `hapi-paged-read.pq` and `package-search-query.pq` respectively - comments in these files point to where to get these.
